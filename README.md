spd1.3 group project

Our webapp is built with Next.js (https://nextjs.org/learn).

## Running the development server

To start the development server `cd` into the directory called `nextjs-blog`:

```bash
$ cd nextjs-blog
```

Then, run the following command: 

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

This starts the Next.js web-app on port 3000.
Open http://localhost:3000 from your browser to check if it's working.
